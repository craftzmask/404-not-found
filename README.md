Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

  - Currently, I don't have demo link for it.
- What was your experience?
  - Even though this is just a simple web page but building it from scratch using only HTML and CSS taught me a lot about how to construct HTML and using Flexbox to do responsive design.

  - CSS is not that bad, just it a try, you will learn it well.
